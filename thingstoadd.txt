things to add:

lock piechart when venue is clicked (and unlock when clicked again)
have reset buttons for piechart, flags
for tooltips, change background (maybe? just make more legible)
decide color ramps for genres, flags
	whether to have one color (various versions of the color) for genres and countries
		cool / warm colors maybe?
	have it be a different color each for the pie chart
add delay function for flags
generate topojson of streets (using a django api)
devise starting placement of colors (opening map should tell story)
	perhaps highlight corridors/neighborhoods?
try to eliminate hack-y try/catch functions in code
	especially when adding countries: bolivarian republic of venezuela
	add UN flag to countries that cannot be identified?
somehow mark venues that have >50% artists from that city + surrounding cities
contact songkick, echonest
	get research api code possibly
implement a zoom feature
	even just a plus/minus that reloads the map with a different projection scale
investigate way to cache all previous api calls
	better way: get all past concerts of a venue

done:

changed font to Baskerville
disabled segment pullout
added currently highlighted data
find some way to dynamically get nearby cities
	songkick metroid, with lower limit 25% of len(venues_largest_city)?
